# Linear Regression

In this repository you can find Jupyter Notebooks on Linear Regression Models that you should work on together as Pair-Programmers.

## Objective 
At the end of this repo you should:
* Have an understanding of linear regression for explanatory analysis
* Know how to use the statsmodel library for OLS
* Understand the usage of linear regression
* Know how to interpret the output of a Linear Regression model 
## Task
Please make sure you have **forked** the repo and activated your nf_base environment.

This repo covers:
* Simple Linear Regression + exercises
* Multiple Linear Regression  + exercises

In case you still have time left or want to deepen your knowledge with regard to this topic later during the course, work through these two extra credit notebooks:

* Limitations of Linear Regression
* Interacting with Categorical Variables
